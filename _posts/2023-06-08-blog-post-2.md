Programming Background

## Programming Prior to ST558

Before taking this course, I had experience with SAS and Python.
Compared to SAS, I find that R’s usage is more broad, and the syntax is
more userfriendly. I found that learning Python is a little easier than
R, but that could be due to the fact that I’m exposed to more functions
in R than Python. Overall, I find the syntax of R easy to understand and
learn, especially if you have a background in statistics.  
What I like most about R is that it has a big user community. When I run
into any errors, I go to google and find that many others have run into
the same issue and there are multiple solutions. I also like that anyone
can create a function in R, and the only thing you need to do is
download it from the internet to be able to use it. The fact that there
are many usages of R that I’m not aware of keeps me excited to continue
exploring!
