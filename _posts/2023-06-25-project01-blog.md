Exploring APIs

## My Exerience with APIs

In this project, I wanted to explore more about different titles of
movies, series, and episodes from the Movies API, so I created a
function that takes in the title and the type and outputs multiple
information about it including, its IMDb Rating, Box Office earnings,
genre, and much more.  
I, then, called this function using many titles, and did some analysis
on the findings including some categorical, numerical, and graphical
analysis. The results I found were not very surprising, but it was
interesting to find that the IMDb Rate of the movies I picked in the
\`Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi’ had less variation than the 2 movies in the
‘Crime, Drama’ genre.  
What I would do differently in approaching a similar project in the
future is to explore more of the data present or maybe pick a different
API that would have more variation, such as sports ratings for example.

The part I found the hardest was coding the function to be able to
access multiple endpoints. This was the hardest because the result would
be different for each endpoint since they don’t all contain the same
information.
